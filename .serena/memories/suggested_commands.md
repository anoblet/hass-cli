# Suggested Commands

- `npm install` — install project dependencies.
- `npm start -- <command>` — invoke CLI via package script (executes `node bin/hass-cli.js`). Alternatively use `node bin/hass-cli.js ...`.
- `npx hass-cli <command>` — run published CLI directly when installed globally via npm link or package install.
- `npm link` — optionally expose `hass-cli` as a global binary during development.
- `npm test` — currently placeholder (prints error).
